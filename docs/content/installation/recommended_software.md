There are a few software that are worth the pain of installing to use along with Baston. They are not mandatory to use it but they can be quite useful to enhance your experience or to try new ideas quickly. They range from tools and utilities to software synthesizers, etc. I am recommending them because most of them are free and open-source. When they are not, they are simply too good to be ignored and have decent commercial policies. Most are also very popular in the live coding community.

## Software synthesizers

- **[Dexed](https://asb2m10.github.io/dexed/)**: Dexed is a free and open-source software synthesizer. It is a clone of the Yamaha DX7, a famous FM synthesizer from the 80s.
- **[Surge](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/)**: Surge is a free and open-source software synthesizer. It is a hybrid synthesizer with an immense sonic palette.
- **[Vital](https://vital.audio/)**: Vital is a free and open-source software synthesizer. It is a popular wavetable synthesizer. 
- **[VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/)**: VCV Rack is an open-source virtual modular synthesizer. It emulates Eurorack modular synthesizers. It is a standalone application that you can use to create complex modular synthesis patches. You can control it with Baston.
- **[SunVox](https://warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/)**: SunVoX is a free and open-source music-making software. It is a modular synthesizer and a tracker. 

## Audio programming languages / platforms

- **[SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/)**: SuperCollider is a platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition. It is free and open-source. It is widely used in the live coding community. You can use it as a [software synthesizer](../configuration/supercollider.md) in Baston.
- **[Pure Data](https://puredata.info/)**: Pure Data is the ubiquitous visual programming language for audio synthesis. It is free and open-source. It is widely used in the live coding community. Use it to build anything that can be useful along with Baston. Please pay attention to [Plug Data](https://plugdata.org/), a modern departure from the classic and obsolete interface of Pure Data.

## About Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs)

Use your favorite DAW, if you have one. To get the best synergy with Baston, I recommend using any [Ableton Link](https://www.ableton.com/en/link/products/) compatible DAW. This will allow you to synchronize and record much more efficiently. Tell your friends to use a compatible DAW too, so you can jam together.
