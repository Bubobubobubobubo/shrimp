title: Baston - Live Coding with Python
---

Test Test

Welcome to the #baston documentation! Baston is a [live coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding) environment for Python. It is designed to be simple to use and lightweight. Baston allows you to _live code_ pretty much everything: hardware and software synthesizers, audio, data, etc. You can create and manipulate sound, rhythms and melodies in real-time, and experiment with pattern creation. It can be used for _live coding_ and composition. I have designed it to be used in live performances like [Algoraves](https://algorave.com). Baston can be considered both as a **library** and a **standalone application**. You can import it in your Python scripts and use it as a library, or you can use it as a standalone application with a REPL (Read, Eval, Print, Loop) interface.

>[!faq]- Where to start?
> 1) [Install](installation.md) Baston on your system (MacOS/Linux/Windows) as a Python library
> 2) Peak at the [Configuration](configuration/) section, setup your MIDI and OSC devices 
> 3) Jump to the [Get Started](get_started/) section to learn the basics of Baston

## What can you do with Baston?

- **Improvise electronic music in real-time using software and hardware synthesizers**
  - Control hardware and software synthesizers through MIDI and OSC
  - Synchronize with other software and hardware ([Ableton Link](https://www.ableton.com/en/link/products/))
  - Create and manipulate melodic, rhythmic and sonic patterns
  - Design complex parameter automations and modulations
  - (MacOS) Use the built-in synthesizers of Baston 

- **Compose algorithmic and/or generative music**
  - Use a wide range of built-in objects to create complex patterns
  - Use Baston as a framework to create your own objects and abstractions
  - Schedule events precisely on a timeline for later playback


## Support

If you like Baston, please consider supporting the development process on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/I2I2RSBHF). I am developing free and open-source software on my own. It will help me to keep going and to improve my projects. Thank you!
