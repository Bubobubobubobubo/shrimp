title: 🦐 Shrimp 🦐  - Live Coding Library for Python
---

Welcome! Shrimp is a music [live coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding) framework for Python. Shrimp is designed like a musical instrument, simple in design, lightweight and easy to use. Shrimp allows you to live code anything you might want to control on stage: hardware and software synthesizers, other software, etc. Using Shrimp, you can easily manipulate sounds, rhythms and melodies in real-time with code. 

I have created #shrimp for my personal use in live performances: [Algorithmic Rave Parties](https://algorave.com), jamming with friends, playing with other musicians. Shrimp can be used in a wide range of scenarios: from live coding performances to studio productions, from educational purposes to prototyping new musical ideas. You can import it in your Python scripts and use it as a library. You can also use it as a standalone application with a REPL (Read, Eval, Print, Loop) interface.


>[!faq] Where to start?
> 1) [Install](installation.md) Shrimp on your system (MacOS/Linux/Windows) as a Python library
> 2) Peak at the [Configuration](configuration/) section, setup your MIDI and OSC devices 
>    - (Optional) Take some time to pick your favorite [text editor](/configuration/editors/)
> 3) Jump to the [Get Started](get_started/) section to learn the basics of Shrimp
> 4) Find inspiration and learn more about #shrimp in the [reference](reference/) section

## What can you do with Shrimp?

- **Improvise electronic music in real-time using software and hardware synthesizers**
  - Control hardware and software synthesizers through MIDI and OSC
  - Synchronize with other software and hardware ([Ableton Link](https://www.ableton.com/en/link/products/))
  - Create and manipulate melodic, rhythmic and sonic patterns
  - Design complex parameter automations and modulations
  - (MacOS) Use the built-in synthesizers of Shrimp 

- **Compose algorithmic and/or generative music**
  - Use a wide range of built-in objects to create complex patterns
  - Use Shrimp as a framework to create your own objects and abstractions
  - Schedule events precisely on a timeline for later playback


## Support

If you like Shrimp, please consider supporting the development process on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/I2I2RSBHF). I am developing free and open-source software on my own. It will help me to keep going and to improve my projects. Thank you!
